            Lorem Ipsum
            "Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit..."
            "There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is
            pain..."
            What is Lorem Ipsum?
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
            industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
            scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
            electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
            Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
            Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            Why do we use it?
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
            looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
            letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
            desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
            search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
            over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).


            Where does it come from?
            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
            Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
            Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem
            Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
            source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes
            of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
            during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
            section 1.10.32.

            The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections
            1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact
            original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

            Where can I get some?
            There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in
            some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are
            going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the
            middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
            necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin
            words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
            The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic
            words etc.

            1914 translation by H. Rackham
            "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and
            I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of
            the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
            because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
            consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain
            pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can
            procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
            exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who
            chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no
            resultant pleasure?"

            Section 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45 BC
            "At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti
            atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique
            sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum
            facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil
            impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor
            repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et
            voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus,
            ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat."

            1914 translation by H. Rackham
            "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
            demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain
            and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through
            weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are
            perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when
            nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain
            avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will
            frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always
            holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
            pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."

            source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes
            of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
            during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
            section 1.10.32.

            The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections
            1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact
            original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

            Where can I get some?
            There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in
            some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are
            going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the
            middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
            necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin
            words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
            The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic
            words etc.

            because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
            consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain
            pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can
            procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
            exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who
            chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no
            resultant pleasure?"

            Section 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45 BC

            1914 translation by H. Rackham
            "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
            demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain
            and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through
            weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are
            perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when
            nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain
            avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will
            frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always
            holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
            pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."

            "There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is
            pain..."
            What is Lorem Ipsum?
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
            industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
            scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
            electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
            Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
            Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            Why do we use it?
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
            looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
            letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
            desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
            search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
            over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).


            Where does it come from?
            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
            Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
            Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem
            Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
            source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes
            of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
            during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
            section 1.10.32.

            The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections
            1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact
            original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
